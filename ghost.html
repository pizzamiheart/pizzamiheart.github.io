                <ul>
                    <li>I like doing things and making things. I missed out on Legos as a kid and have found tech (and now AI) to be a great way to build.</li>
                    <li>Professionally, I was a director at a summer camp in Western North Carolina for 6 years. I've worked freelancing marketing with outdoor-based clients like the Life Time Sea Otter CLassic. I've worked operations/booking for a musician, David LaMotte. Right now, I am a recruiter.</li>
                    <li>I like thinking, over-philosophizing, and learning from interesting people.</li>
                    <li>I'm married to Sadie, a dad of 2 (a 3rd soon!), and I try act in the world in a way that makes them believe they can do things and participate in what feels like the coolest time to be alive.</li>
                    <li>Live in Black Mountain, NC, like running, being in the mountains, tinkering with building things, and being with my family/friends.</li>
                    <li>Huge desire to do interesting work.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 class="title">Project Description & Motivation</h2>
            <p>I've never seen a job descritpion and immediately found a way to do the job. I'm glad I got to do this for Ghost.</p>
            <p>AI (and similar automation) can speed up the first step of almost anything. For Ghost, this can get a new client to more human results, faster. By scraping for trending topics in a client's industry, analyzing and compressing the results with an LLM, and surfacing some relevant first research and ideas, Ghost writers can get started creating quicker.</p>
            <p>I think I can help Ghost grow by making more things more efficient and giving time back to creators.</p>
