# Welcome, there

I'm an interested person looking to openly live and enjoy my life. My website contains various aspects of me:

- my writing
- things I'm working on and doing
- and what I'm up to at the moment

While I'm not technical, I enjoy the intersection of technology and life. I write about that, its influence on lived experience, progress, soccer, religious faith, and lots of other things I find interesting.
