        <h2>November, 2024</h2>
        <p>i got lucky realizing that today was 11/30, the last day to write a November update during the month. i guess, in that tone, i feel as if it's been a very fast month. Goldie, our third baby, was born, sooner than we expected, on 11/16! so the last two weeks have been very wrapped up in her in just the best way. i can't believe we have her. the birth was a bit quick and scary in some moments, but we are healthy and grateful for new life in our family.</p>
        <p>since the hurricane, we've continued to feel unbelievably supported by our friends and family, and those we don't know. mom and dad were here for the first week of Goldie's life. dad worked over at the house every day trying to mend the broken things. mom made lots of food and provided good support. Linda got here a a week ago and has give lots of support with meals and taking kids to the playground. Thanksgiving was wonderful :) we went to Emily and Michaels for the day. who knew you could smoke a turkey. Michael and I shared Cold Mountains, I threw balls in the backyard with Shepherd, and Greta was mischevious as usual, bringing home some of their coasters in Goldie's diaper bag.</p>
        <p>i've been pretty furiously working on my newest project, <a href="https://foundationessays.com/" target="_blank">Foundation</a>. it's a passion project - building a library of essays and blogs from like the coolest and most important people in tech - and i've gotten the most feedback (and positive) on it that any other project. better keep going! </p>
        <p>cheers to December and Christmas! I'm hoping we're going to be back in the house around 12/20, just in time for Christmas. staying at Paul and Lisle's has been a huge gift, and we're ready to go home :)</p>

    <h2>October, 2024</h2>
    <p>on September 27th, Hurricane Helen hit the mountains of western North Carolina and where we live in the Swannanoa Valley and surrounding Asheville area pretty bad. after 2 initial weeks staying with my folks in Mississippi, we got home on 10/12. our house was decently flooded (all exterior). we're staying at our friend Amy's for 2 weeks, then staying at our friend Paul's family's house in Montreat for at least a month after. fingers crossed, we're back in our house by the time baby #3 arrives mid-December! I wrote up my recollection of the day of, and day after, the hurricane <a href="https://blog.andrewginn.fun/" target="_blank"></a>here on my blog.</a></p>
