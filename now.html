        <h2>Season of Life</h2>
        <p>We are closely anticipating the arrival of our third child, a baby girl, due mid-December. We are also hoping to be back into our house, post-Hurricane Helene repairs, in the next week or two.</p>
        <p>At this point, I think all of our friends have moved back into town from their disaparte locations caused by the hurricane. We are enjoying one another's company and it seems like invitations to go and meet one another with our kids place are abundant.</p>
        <p>It's clear with fall/autumn, that it's a changing season all around and I am trying to enjoy it and be alive to it.</p>

        <h2 class="section">Work/Vocation/Interests</h2>
        <h4>Interests: I have an active interest in working on a project of some kind that does something with AI or "building-the-future"-type-efforts. It's hard to say exactly what I mean by that, but if I total control over how I were spending my day, from a working perspective, I would be working on something useful with a small group of people.</h4>
        <h4 class="section"> Work: I think LinkedIn is a black hole but <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-c-ginn/" target="_blank"> here I am on it</a></h4>
        <h4>Vocation: husband, father, <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/66737283" target="_blank">runner</a>, friend, church member at a beautiful place, listener, curious person</h4>
