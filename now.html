        <p>Goldie was born on 11/16! our 3rd baby. what a gift. even though this is our third, i've had these sensations of like, "i've gotta start getting haircuts more regularly and go to the doctor more often. i've gotta take care of myself - there's a baby in the world!"

        <h4>Interests: I have an active interest in working on a project of some kind that does something with AI or "building-the-future"-type-efforts. It's hard to say exactly what I mean by that, but if I total control over how I were spending my day, from a working perspective, I would be working on something useful with a small group of people.</h4>
        <h4 class="section"> Work: I think LinkedIn is a black hole but <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-c-ginn/" target="_blank"> here I am on it</a></h4>
        <h4>Vocation: husband, father, <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/66737283" target="_blank">runner</a>, friend, church member at a beautiful place, listener, curious person</h4>
