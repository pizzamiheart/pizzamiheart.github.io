Right now, I am living in Black Mountain, North Carolina where I have lived the last 7 years.

My wife Sadie and I have two kids and live at the end of wolf creek, right at the edge of a tree line with wolf creek running right through our backyard. We had a decent summer garden growing yellow straight-neck squash, bush beans, two pepper varieties, tomatoes, and lettuce.

We just became deacons at our church, Black Mountain Presbyterian, which we're glad for and hoping that will take us even deeper into community and friendship with others.
