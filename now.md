Right now, I am living in Black Mountain, North Carolina where I have lived the last 7 years.

My wife Sadie and I have two kids and live at the end of wolf creek, right at the edge of a tree line with wolf creek running right through our backyard. We had a decent summer garden growing yellow straight-neck squash, bush beans, two pepper varieties, tomatoes, and lettuce.

We just became deacons at our church, Black Mountain Presbyterian, which we're glad for and hoping that will take us even deeper into community and friendship with others.

#### Professionally/Work

For work, I have been freelancing since February 2023 after leaving a remote job I didn't like very much.

#### Projects/Business

At the beginning of August, 2023, my friend Will Alexandar and I started a business called Brain Trust [braintrust.life](https://www.braintrust.life/) and I'm having a blast and learning a ton in new territory. We're about to seek funding to take it full time and launch.

#### What I'm Up to

I'm "reading" several books: 
- Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - Douglas Adams, 69% complete<
- Hackers and Painters - Paul Graham, 38% complete
- Meditiations - Marcus Aurelius, 17% complete
- Moby Dick: or, the White Wale - Herman Melville, 4% complete
- Goodbye Things - Fumio Sasaki, 33% complete

#### What I'm Noticing

Something I'm noticing is how important it is to just be present in my life and enjoy the day...
