    <p>Because of AI, one new thing I have become is a developer of software and apps and products. I think calling myself a software developer is a bit contentious among the "we were already here" developer-types, but oh well.</p>
    <p>I'm having lots of fun doing it. These are all things I've finished or are in progress. If they're on here, I tinker with them in some fashion and may one day finish it.</p>
